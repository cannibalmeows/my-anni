                <p>Happy six month baby! I am so excited to share this time with you. It doesn't feel real that its been
                    six
                    months and I can't believe that I get to call you mine. I love you so much darling; you are my
                    world. I
                    am
                    so happy I have been able to share this time with you and how much fun we've had so far in our
                    relationship.
                    We've been on a few dates and you have given me so many new expiriences that I wouldn't have
                    otherwise.
                    I
                    got to go to Kings Island with you, The lake, and hopefully I will get to meet your family in Hazard
                    soon. I
                    love you so so so much baby. You are beautiful, pretty, stunning, alluring, captivating, sweet,
                    kind,
                    loving, warm, and so much more. Happy six month anniversay sweet girl! I hope you have a fantastic
                    Friday
                    and an even better weekend. </p>
